Made by **Morgan Montague** for *Blog One Module* 
1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
    * Confused by the difference in tools used and not sure on some directions, but I like the content so far. I want redo a few assignments now that I know more.
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
    * More background stuff, like I know HTML, CSS, JS but not much else, I need to review the core tools used in this blog because I did it wrong.
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    * That I don't know a lot... Also I have a webbed toe. So yeah _normal_ stuff right there.
