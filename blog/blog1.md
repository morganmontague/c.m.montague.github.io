- Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
    - Confused by the difference in tools used and not sure on some directions, but I like the content so far. I want redo a few assignments now that I know more.
- What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
    - More background stuff, like I know HTML, CSS, JS but not much else, I need to review the core tools used in this blog because I did it wrong.
- What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    - That I don't know a lot...
