# This is a markdown h1 header
Made by **Morgan Montague** for *Blog One Module* 
1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
    * Confused by the difference in tools used and not sure on some directions, but I like the content so far. I want redo a few assignments now that I know more.
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
    * More background stuff, like I know HTML, CSS, JS but not much else, I need to review the core tools used in this blog because I did it wrong.
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    * That I don't know a lot... Also I have a webbed toe. So yeah _normal_ stuff right there.

4. What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
   * I want to get more comfortable with coding, I am amazed by watching Josh and Jonathon just randomly making working little codes.
5. What are you struggling with?
   * I am struggling with the density of content, each webpage I visit about a new element will just put me in a rabbit hole.
6. How do you solve a problem? 
   * I like to step back and take a breather, then I will try and look at it differenetly, if still nothing I will google or go to help slack.
7. What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
   * Like stated before I try not to get stuck for too long, also google is very nice for this early content.

8. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
   * From a basic comparison I make, HTML is like the bones of an arm, the backbone and what is needs added stuff to, unless you like skeletons. JavaScript adds motion like muscles but can also add psuedo bones like joints and ligiments to help the arm move better and preform different motions. CSS for this example is like pigament of the skin and hair color/density on the arm.
9. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
   * My blog (as in wording) is adding the questions asked by this week's blog prompt.
   * I used Dillenger to practice markdown more this week, sorta type and see application.
      | Dillinger | [https://dillinger.io/] | 
   * However I hope to add what we learned this week into it eventually, example"['arrays', 'addEventListener', 'basic console opertations like .getElementById', camal Casing', 'psuedocode(sill working on that)]
   * I am also trying to use more branches and use vscode more.
10. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
   * pseudocoding is more difficult then originally expected.
   * I was thinking it was like a step by step flow chart like, *add sugar, add eggs, stir*.
   * However watching the demo days I realized sorta lost focus on Justin's youtube videos in the slides, there is a lot more detail needed.
   * It is more like making code readable for everyone changing stuff like (if else, !==, color: white) into more life if your sugar is brown do not use this, you need to use white sugar.
   * I am still trying to learn more on this and I hope to improve it as I go.
