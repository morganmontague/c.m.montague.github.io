# This is a markdown h1 header
Made by **Morgan Montague** for *Blog One Module* 
1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
    * Confused by the difference in tools used and not sure on some directions, but I like the content so far. I want redo a few assignments now that I know more.
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
    * More background stuff, like I know HTML, CSS, JS but not much else, I need to review the core tools used in this blog because I did it wrong.
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    * That I don't know a lot... Also I have a webbed toe. So yeah _normal_ stuff right there.

4. What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
   * I want to get more comfortable with coding, I am amazed by watching Josh and Jonathon just randomly making working little codes.
5. What are you struggling with?
   * I am struggling with the density of content, each webpage I visit about a new element will just put me in a rabbit hole.
6. How do you solve a problem? 
   * I like to step back and take a breather, then I will try and look at it differenetly, if still nothing I will google or go to help slack.
7. What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
   * Like stated before I try not to get stuck for too long, also google is very nice for this early content.

8. What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
   * From a basic comparison I make, HTML is like the bones of an arm, it functions, just look weird without stuff added to it, unless you like skeletons. JavaScript adds motion like muscles but can also add psuedo bones like joints and ligiments to help the arm move better and preform different motions. CSS for this example is like pigament of the skin and hair color/density on the arm.
9. What are some objects that your blog incorporates?
   * My blog (as in wording) is adding the questions asked by this week's blog prompt.
   * I used Dillenger to practice markdown more this week, sorta type and be shown application.
```   
      Dillinger  [https://dillinger.io/]
```
* However I hope to add what we learned this week into it eventually, example['arrays', 'addEventListener', 'basic console opertations like .getElementById', camal Casing', 'psuedocode(sill working on that)]
   * I am also trying to use more branches and use vscode more.
10. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?
   * pseudocoding is more difficult then originally expected.
   * I was thinking it was like a step by step flow chart like, *add sugar, add eggs, stir*.
   * However watching the demo days I realized I lost focus on Justin's youtube videos in the slides, there is a lot more detail needed.
   * It is more like making code readable for everyone changing stuff like (if else, !==, color: white) into more life if your sugar is brown do not use this, you need to use white sugar.
   * This is so you can read and then implement the instructions in different coding languages.
   * I am still trying to learn more on this and I hope to improve it as I go.

11. What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?
   * Really I liked the remote way of things, it made it easy to adapt into the swing of things. During busy days at work I could rest easy knowing I had time later that day to work on pnboarding. The onboarding did pick up pace which helped me realize the pressure needed as well. 
12. What hindered your progress during Onboarding?
   * I would say the material being some that I covered before hindered me honestly. The first two weeks I didn't take things as I should have since I had seen most of it. I should have used the time to research more and get more stretch goals in. 
13. How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?
   * I started treating this like a job, not joining the zoom standups just because I had to, but brought questions and concerns to them. I really started looking into more stuff, and commited more hours to the work. The first no hand holding really woke me up to the desert of despair.

14. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
   - The obvious answer for me is my health, it progressivly got worse as the days went by. It made concentrating more difficult. It made me very nervous about my code and demoday, but it was went better then expected.
15. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
    -   JSON and data structures are still iffy with me, I would like to review them more, but I will get the chance the next week with the weather app. For Bootstrap, I'm not a big fan of, I'd rather make some simple css, but I will admit bootstrap is set up easily but confusing trying to find the right class.
16. How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
What is your “Why”?
    - I was pretty worried about it for a number of reasons.
        - I was sick for starters, I thought it was just a cold I caught from my niece, but it got worse each day. I was worried it was covid but I got negative tests, I was also worried that I might spread what ever I had.
        - Getting adjusted to going in person, without a car was also a worry, that was easier to get used to.
        - Being in person, also brought up mild anxiety but everyone is very kind and friendly so all good there.

17. What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

   - I guess for me is buying into pseudocoding, I felt this week I was more focused on that aspect. I wrote more out, however I am far from good at it. I need to think more logically for this to really take hold.
18. What does it mean to develop good code?
    - For myself, it would be for easy to read and concise code. No hardcoding work arounds, use more object focused attributes. Don't be afraid to try new things in the dev or sandbox branches but don't mess with the main.
19. What does it mean to be a good developer?
   - To start be a good caring person, don't aim for the deadline just to make a buck, be proud of what you put out and strive to better yourself daily.
20. What is one thing that programmers hate doing?
   - uhhh I guess I wouldn't want to be a person to focus on only one type of language because that would limit my oppurtiniies greatly.

21. Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?
   - At first I didn't like the newish react ways. It felt like I added a mod to a game and it changed buttons that are muscle memory. It made me struggle for a while, however after using it for a while, it started to click and I was able to use it easier, and faster.
22. What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?
   - D3 sounds interesting. It would help manage data better and visialize it. For bigger projects or data heavy projects it sounds like this library could help generate html tables or svg bar charts to visual the data.

23. Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.
   D3 for as mentioned above or Cleave.js also sounds interesting for formating text and input. I wouldn't mind trying some of the animation heavy libraies but I am not good with design.

24. What have you learned about CLIs? Do you think they are scary?
   - CLIs were scary when I started, I was afraid I would accidently delete a file I crucially needed. However since getting to know them, they only slightly scary. The rules to follow are usually simple once you get to know them, and it is quite hard to break something unless you write it correctly
25. If you were to build a CLI, what would it do?
   - I really don't know what to put for this.. Uhm maybe color code different key words or the text in general, that way it would be easier to notice a typo.
26. List some ideas that without a Framework, would take you a long time to code
   - Frameworks are diverse and allow for more concise code for desired projects.
      - Repeating code can be cleaned up, or simplified with frameworks.
      - Example would be bootstrap it comes with custom class names which will help make front end management easier.
