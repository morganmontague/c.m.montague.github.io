1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
    * Confused by the difference in tools used and not sure on some directions, but I like the content so far. I want redo a few assignments now that I know more.
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
    * More background stuff, like I know HTML, CSS, JS but not much else, I need to review the core tools used in this blog because I did it wrong.
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
    * That I don't know a lot... Also I have a webbed toe. So yeah _normal_ stuff right there.

4. What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?
   * I want to get more comfortable with coding, I am amazed by watching Josh and Jonathon just randomly making working little codes.
5. What are you struggling with?
   * I am struggling with the density of content, each webpage I visit about a new element will just put me in a rabbit hole.
6. How do you solve a problem? 
   * I like to step back and take a breather, then I will try and look at it differenetly, if still nothing I will google or go to help slack.
7. What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?
   * Like stated before I try not to get stuck for too long, also google is very nice for this early content.
