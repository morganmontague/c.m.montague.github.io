            I am currently enrolled in Awesome Inc.'s Fall Bootcamp. I was born
            and raised in Lexington, Kentucky. I went to the College of
            Charleston in South Carolina. After my four years there, I recieved
            a Bachelor of Science in Biology. <br />
            I moved back to Lexington, I volunteered some for Sister Cities and
            started working as a Law Clerk for a few firms. After a few years of
            this and the pandemic I decided to make a career change to better
            prepare myself for the future. Awesome Inc. provided the beggining
            with an Intro to Web course. I am learning to become a web developer
            in a great enviroment and I'm excited for the future. <br />
            >I have experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. I am
            looking forward to learning more languages during this boot camp to
            increase my skills. My college and work experience was heavy on data
            manipulation and I'm excited to learn ways to make life easier for
            others in those feilds.
