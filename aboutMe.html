            I am currently enrolled in Awesome Inc.'s Fall Bootcamp. I was born and raised in Lexington, Kentucky. 
            I went to the College of Charleston in South Carolina. After my four years there, I recieved a Bachelor of 
            Science in Biology. <br> I moved back to Lexington, I volunteered some for Sister Cities and started working as a 
            Law Clerk for a few firms. After a few years of this and the pandemic I decided to make a career change to better 
            prepare myself for the future. Awesome Inc. provided the beggining with an Intro to Web course. I am learning to 
            become a web developer in a great enviroment and I'm excited for the future.
        </div>
        <div class="container">I have experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. I am looking forward to learning more languages during this boot camp to increase my skills. My college and work experience was heavy on data manipulation and I'm excited to learn ways to make life easier for others in those feilds.</div>
