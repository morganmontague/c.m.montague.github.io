            Some people like me will ask what is pseudocode and how does it help with programming?
            <br>
            When I fist started to learn to code, pseudocode sounded like a vaugue outline, just getting the mainpoints with html, css and javacript.
            This worked for the first few projects where it was more learning the basics worked out. However once logic based problems came into play I was struggling.
            When it comes to challenges with multiple logic problems, pseuducode is the way to go. If you can break the big problems into smaller ones that is a good start.
            However for this bigger problems the way and order you decide to complete them in can change the answer completely.
            <br>
            Try to imagine a math promblem without pemdas or P- Parentheses, E- Exponents, M- Multiplication, D- Division, A- Addition, and S- Subtraction.
            3 + 4 * 2 = x, will create two different answers. If you go left to right the answer will be 2 + 3 = 7, 7*2 = 14. With Pemdas it goes 4 * 2 = 8 + 3 = 11.
            The correct answer mathatically is 11, however this depends on the langueage you want to use. Knoeing the basic logic of the program and the language used can help control the harder problems later.

            <br>

            The importance of pseudocode is to think of these logic problems before you start coding, and possibly wasting time once you realize this language doesn't support that process, so you can think of another way to solve the problem.
